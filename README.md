# Customer-Churn-IBM-dataset-
# Team Phoenix has banded together to find out what affects customer churn most, and how much money people spend when they fall into the "retained" category or "churned" category.
# The team uses IBM's Telecommunications dataset with over 7 thousand rows. 
# First you'll see us wrangle data in Python and R. Next, we come up with some extra questions to ask which help us understand our data better. Then we use a few visualizations to illustrate that understanding
# Finally, we execute the statistical analyses needed to come to our conclusions about customer Churn.
